I was inspired to write this `/purpose` page by the folks over at [Fictive Kin](https://slashpurpose.org/).

While my blog/portfolio site are brand new to the internet, the purpose of what I write and create on here will grow with time. For now, I'm building personal corner of the internet, so I can share my thoughts, have a place to test out new code ideas, and archive the random things I do for future generations.
Of course, when I think of archiving, I do think of how much of the web we have [lost](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/internet-dead-links-webpages-online-content-b2549215.html) over the last while.
Hopefully, through the creation of this site, and I'll inspire my friends to create more like it, we can bring the World Wide Web back to its former glory, where it was filled with random treasure troves of information, and everyone had their own corner to share.
