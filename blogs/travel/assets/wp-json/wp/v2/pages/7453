A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a &#x201C;device&#x201D;) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.<\/p>\n<p>First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting.

Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor&#x2019;s referral source to a particular website.
