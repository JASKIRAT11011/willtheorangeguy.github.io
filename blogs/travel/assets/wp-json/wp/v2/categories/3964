{"id":3964,"count":16,"description":"<h2>Italy<\/h2>\r\nBeauty is in the details, in lovable Italy! It\u2019s the skip in the step of an old Italian grandpa, after his morning espresso. In the stringy mozzarella, as it falls off the perfect Italian pizza. In the beaming smile of the Vespa driver, as he drives over the Tuscan hills, through fields of sunflowers. All these beautiful details create an atmosphere that leaves travelers falling deeply in love with Italy.\r\n\r\nThe incredibly well-preserved history of Italy is what makes the country unique. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/travel-blogs\/rome\/\">Rome<\/a> still looks almost exactly as it did thousands of years ago! Walking the same path as the Romans did all that time ago is indeed a unique way to be a part of history. But Rome isn\u2019t the only city worth visiting. Admire magical, floating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/travel-blogs\/venice\/\">Venice<\/a>, from a gondola, absorbing the romantic personality of the town. Alternatively, watch as the sun changes the colors of the marble, as it hits the cathedral of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/travel-blogs\/florence\/\">Florence<\/a>.\r\n<h3>The Italian coastline<\/h3>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve absorbed all the Italian history and art that there is to offer, head to the idyllic Italian coast. Discover areas such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/travel-blogs\/cinque-terre\/\">Cinque Terre<\/a>, where layers of colored houses sink into the olive groves and cliffs. The incredible beauty of the hot Italian sun, shining on deep blue ocean and bouncing off the green cliffs, is hard to put into words. Cooling off in the deep sea and eating refreshing gelato, are just two activities that shape an Italian trip. It is also the intake of more pizza and pasta than you could have ever dreamt of. But overwhelmingly, it is an incredible satisfaction at the end of the day, after seeing so many beautiful things.","link":"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/italy\/","name":"Italy","slug":"italy","taxonomy":"category","parent":0,"meta":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v19.7.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Italy Travel Guides &amp; Tips - Salt in our Hair Blog<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Italy is Europe&#039;s favorite travel destination but it is more than pizza, pasta &amp; gelato!
