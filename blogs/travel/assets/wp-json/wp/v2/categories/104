{"id":104,"count":10,"description":"<h2>The Netherlands<\/h2>\r\nA country with a rare combination of beautiful old-world charm and innovation. Discover old fashioned townhouses, and churches, that neighbor cutting edge buildings, modern cafes, and vintage shops. For a country with so much wow-factor, the Netherlands is often underestimated as a travel destination. The country is home to beautifully long, sandy coastlines and dunes, accompanied by a fierce northerly wind. All of which makes it excellent for a myriad of water sports.\r\n<h3>A flat landscape<\/h3>\r\nUndercutting the rough and rugged coastline is the beautiful, green, flat countryside that stretches as far as the eye can see. Throughout which are infinite romantic villages like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/netherlands\/volendam-marken\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Volendam and Marken<\/a> and charming windmills. The beauty of this landscape reaches new heights during the months of April to May. At this time the luscious green fields explode into a rainbow of colors, as tulips bloom. Experience perfect rows of colorful symmetry- a photographer\u2019s paradise!\r\n<h3>Mesmerizing cities<\/h3>\r\nHowever, the Netherlands is most famous for the Dutch-renaissance beauty of Amsterdam. Discover cobbled streets sandwiched between beautiful rickety townhouses and the lazy flow of the canal. Spend days here, exploring a way of life by bicycle- the icon of the Netherlands. However, it is not just Amsterdam which will captivate the heart. There are many other mesmerizing cities, such as the contemporary and innovative skyline of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/travel-blogs\/rotterdam-things-to-do\/\">Rotterdam<\/a> or the tree-lined canals of Utrecht. Because of its small size, it is incredibly easy to explore and travelers can cover a multitude of beautiful locations in a short space of time. The beauty of the Netherlands is waiting to be discovered!","link":"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/netherlands\/","name":"Netherlands","slug":"netherlands","taxonomy":"category","parent":0,"meta":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v19.7.1) -
