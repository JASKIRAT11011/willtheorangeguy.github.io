{"id":4750,"count":118,"description":"<h2>Europe<\/h2>\r\nEurope is the continent of hopeless romantics. A place that radiates warmth, happiness, and enchantment in the form of hot summer nights, under the stars. By day, wander picturesque streets, laughing and chatting, or dip salty, sunkissed skin in beautiful blue waters. Continue to feed the soul by visiting the most sensational cities in the world! Each magical European city writes a love letter to the past, through its buildings and customs. For example, the abstract works of Gaudi in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/spain\/barcelona-city-trip-guide\/\">Barcelona<\/a>, the love lock bridge of Paris, or the exotic grand bazaar of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/turkey\/istanbul-balat\/\">Istanbul<\/a>. Alternatively, get ready for an epic adventure through the ages. Discover wonders like the majestic acropolis in Athens, the magnificent Colosseum in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/italy\/rome\/\">Rome<\/a>, or the remarkable floating city of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/italy\/venice\/\">Venice<\/a>.\r\n<h3>Crossing Borders and Cultures<\/h3>\r\nEach nation, however small, has its own unique culture and language. As a result, Europe is one of a kind. In just 24 hours several countries could be visited, each with a different beauty, landscape, culture, and language. Experience the icy charm of northern Europe, with its epic fjords, snow-capped mountains, frosty blue lakes, and hilltop castles. Together with the vibrancy of southern Europe, with its colorful houses, street art, shady cobbled streets, bustling plazas, and heavenly islands. The diversity of a continent which stretches as far as the Arctic Circle, and borders both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/africa\/\">Africa<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/asia\/\">Asia<\/a>, is hard to beat.\r\n<h3>A Food Lovers Heaven<\/h3>\r\nEuropean diversity makes for a legendary culinary journey. Jumping from country to country will provide new, and delicious, experiences. Each of which will kickstart taste buds into action. Discover tapas in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/spain\/\">Spain<\/a>, pizza in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/italy\/\">Italy<\/a>, pastries in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/france\/\">France<\/a>, fondue in Switzerland, bratwurst in Germany, kebab in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/turkey\/\">Turkey<\/a>, or khachapuri in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.saltinourhair.com\/georgia\/\">Georgia<\/a>. Because of the freedom of movement between European countries, each country is multicultural in its people and in its cuisine, always open to new things and fusing ideas.
