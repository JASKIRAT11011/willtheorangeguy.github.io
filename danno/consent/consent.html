    Hello, my name is Daniela Sada, and I am an AP Research student at Walnut Grove Secondary School. I am working on a research project about people's views on technology used for alternate meat development. You have been selected to participate in this study because I have chosen to survey adults, since they will provide a different perspective on my topic, compared to the grade elevens and twelves that will also be surveyed.
